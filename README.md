## Motivation

Why another form library for react/redux ecosystem? Main reasons are:

* First class TypeScript support (fully written in TypeScript).
* Expose API as Redux action creators and selector instead of React components (or HOC). One of the main pain point of other libraries is that they treat Redux part as second class and it is extremely hard to use them without HOC and helper components.
